# The Maker Console

MakerSquare's maker console for makers making maker stuff.

## Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Build Production Files

The Maker Console uses [Gulp.js](http://www.gulpjs.com) to compile it's CoffeeScript into minified and non-minified concatenated production files located in the root directory.

This is all accomplished in one command that should follow AFTER your npm install:

```bash
$ gulp build
```
